- #2 covers the compilation process in deeper detial than I did in #1.
- #3 is the solution to the `Block Letters` project that Codecademy has.
- #4 covers variables, which you'll be familiar with if you've done Algebra.
- #5 covers math.
- #6 showcases how you can get user input.
- #7 shows how to implement the `C = (F - 32) / 1.8` formula for converting Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius.
- #8 shows how to implement the Quadratic Formula, for solving the x's of a quadratic equation.
- #9 covers Datatype Modifiers and Type conversion.
- #10 covers conditionals.
- #11 is a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.
- #12 covers loops.
- #13 is a short choose-your-own adventure game I made for CodeCademy.

- #15 covers Functions.
- #16 is a mini-lesson on running code from another file.
- #17 is a game of tic-tak-toe played via console by two players.  (Undocumented)
- #18 covers Classes, which is the whole reason I started learning Java, and by extension, C++.
- #19 covers pointers & references, which allow variables to be referenced, instead of copied.
- #20 covers Dynamic Classes and destruction.
- #21 is an example program that converts a string to a runnable conditional.
